# InSight-FYP
Scripts and notebooks used for my Final Year Project 


The notebooks in this repository are meant to act as a sandbox environment to play around with the data. 

The 'format' script includes functions used for transforming data into an appropriate format (e.g. extracting labelled samples).

The 'marsHHT' script includes functions used for implementing the HHT and various forms of the associated EMD algorithms.

The 'LabelledSpectrogramGenerator' script includes functions able to generate and save/load pickled labelled spectrogram plots given data and labels.
